this is my linear algebra study project.
I will keep study plan, progress, course note and other stuff here.

work out a best way for me to study linear algebra and other deep learning topics more efficient.

** latex math 
     \begin{equation}
     x=\sqrt{b}
     \end{equation}
     
     If $a^2=b$ and \( b=2 \), then the solution must be
     either $$ a=+\sqrt{2} $$ or \[ a=-\sqrt{2} \].
